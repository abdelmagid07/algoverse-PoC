"""Shared interp foundations for the Veritas PoC.

Holds the three things every other interp/analysis module needs to agree on:
  * how the model is loaded and which device it runs on,
  * the single scalar "answer-logit" metric that both patching methods perturb,
  * residual-stream caching to disk (Phase 1 checkpoint).

The answer-logit metric is the crux of the whole comparison: attribution
patching (fast) and activation patching (slow) must both measure their effect
on the *same* number, or the correlation is meaningless. See ANSWER_CUE below.
